Python for: 
  It is a iterator based loop. It iterates over tuples, dictionary, string, set, and lists. When it iterates over a sequence its called a traversal, this continues until it hits
  the end of the sequence.
  Ex. this code iterates over items and prints out each element in a list
      item = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      for i in items:
        print(i)
        
        
Java class:
it is a user defined name to where the user can create objects of the class. It is a constructor for the objects and represents a set of properties or methods that can be common for the objects
Ex. 

public class Main{
  int will = 101;
  public static void main(String[] args){
  Main yes = new Main();
  System.out.println(yes, will);
  }
}


C++ Function:
Set of more than 1 statements that takes in input(s) and has some output(s). We use the functions for reusability to reduce the amount of code

C Switch:
is the combination of one or more cases and it replaces the if then else statement and compares the input variable to multiple different values. 
Syntax:
switch(input) {
case 1:
break;
case 2:
break;
case 3:
break;
default:
}

Java Booleans Expressions:
value that is TRUE or FALSE that is used for evaluating different expressions, they use boolean data type and used with mathmatical expressions, >, <, >=, <=, ==. !=.
